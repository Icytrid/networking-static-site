# 📡 Networking Architecture & Wi-Fi Evolution Demo

A structured static website explaining networking architecture and wireless evolution from a system design perspective.

This project covers:

- WAN / LAN / VLAN architecture fundamentals  
- VLAN segmentation logic (Access / Trunk / 802.1Q Tagging)  
- Router role in traffic control and stability  
- Wi-Fi 6 / 6E / 7 / 8 positioning  
- Router × Wi-Fi generation pairing strategy  

Built with pure HTML / CSS / Vanilla JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created to:

- Clarify networking fundamentals through layered architecture  
- Connect infrastructure concepts to real-world experience  
- Demonstrate structured system thinking  
- Translate technical logic into product-level decision frameworks  

Instead of listing definitions, the site builds concepts in deployment order.

## 🧠 Architecture Flow

WAN → LAN → VLAN → Router → Wi-Fi Generation → Upgrade Strategy

This mirrors real-world network design progression:

1. WAN connects locations  
2. LAN builds local network environment  
3. VLAN segments traffic logically  
4. Router manages routing and policies  
5. Wi-Fi generation defines performance ceiling  
6. Device × Router pairing determines actual experience  

The structure intentionally follows how networks are actually designed and deployed.

## 🧩 Core Sections

### 1️⃣ WAN / LAN / VLAN

- Clear scope distinction  
- Visual diagrams for each layer  
- Logical transition between network levels  
- Practical enterprise & home use cases  

---

### 2️⃣ VLAN Segmentation Deep Dive

Explains:

- Why segmentation is necessary  
- Multi-switch topology challenges  
- Access vs Trunk ports  
- 802.1Q tagging mechanism  
- VLAN ID examples (10 / 20 / 30)

Includes simplified topology visualization.

### 3️⃣ Router Upgrade Logic

Highlights:

- Multi-device scheduling  
- Stability vs bandwidth misconception  
- Latency control importance  
- Why router upgrades often improve experience more than ISP speed upgrades  

---

### 4️⃣ Wi-Fi Generation Comparison

Interactive comparison across:

- Throughput  
- Latency  
- Reliability  
- Interference handling  

Dynamic scoring implemented in Vanilla JavaScript.

### 5️⃣ Router × Wi-Fi Pairing Matrix

Demonstrates performance ceiling logic:

Device Capability × Router Capability = Actual Experience

Clarifies:

- Why Wi-Fi 7 router ≠ automatic 5-star outcome  
- Why older devices gain stability but not peak throughput  
- Where diminishing returns appear  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (custom theme system + light/dark mode)  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- IntersectionObserver (sidebar active tracking)  
- Fully static architecture  

No framework used intentionally for clarity and portability.
