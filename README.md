# 📡 Networking Architecture & Wi-Fi Evolution  
### A Structured Learning Site

This project is a structured static website explaining **WAN / LAN / VLAN**, the role of a **router**, and the evolution of **WiFi 6 / 6E / 7 / 8**.

Rather than focusing only on definitions, it highlights:

- How network structure affects real-world stability and experience  
- How WiFi generations differ in throughput, latency, reliability, and interference  
- How to think about router upgrades and WiFi pairing choices  

---

## 🧭 Learning Flow

WAN → LAN → VLAN → Router → WiFi Generation → Upgrade Strategy

This order mirrors how networking issues are typically encountered in real environments, from internet connection to wireless upgrade decisions.
