# 📡 Networking Architecture & Wi-Fi Evolution  
### A Product Thinking Demonstration

This project is a structured static website that explains networking architecture and wireless evolution through a product management perspective.

Instead of focusing only on technical definitions, it explores:

- How infrastructure decisions affect user experience  
- How capability ceilings interact with device ecosystems  
- How upgrade strategies should be evaluated  
- How system layers influence real-world performance  

---

## 🎯 Product Perspective

Networking products are often misunderstood as “speed upgrades.”

This project reframes networking through a decision model:

- Architecture defines constraints  
- Router defines traffic behavior  
- Wi-Fi generation defines theoretical ceiling  
- Device ecosystem defines realized performance  
- Environment defines stability  

The objective is not to chase peak specifications, but to optimize actual user experience.

## 🧠 Structured Architecture Logic

The site builds concepts in real deployment order:

WAN → LAN → VLAN → Router → Wi-Fi Generation → Upgrade Strategy

Why this order?

Because it mirrors real infrastructure layering:

1. WAN – external connectivity scope  
2. LAN – internal environment construction  
3. VLAN – logical segmentation for isolation and security  
4. Router – policy control, scheduling, congestion management  
5. Wi-Fi generation – capability ceiling  
6. Device × Router pairing – real experience outcome  

This sequence demonstrates system dependency and upgrade leverage points.

## 🧩 Core Modules & PM Insights

### 1️⃣ WAN / LAN / VLAN

- Clear scope separation  
- Visualized logical vs physical segmentation  
- Home and enterprise examples  

PM Insight:  
Clear scope modeling prevents feature misinterpretation and deployment errors.

---

### 2️⃣ VLAN Segmentation & 802.1Q

Explains:

- Why segmentation is necessary  
- Multi-switch topology challenges  
- Access vs Trunk ports  
- 802.1Q tagging logic  
- VLAN ID mapping examples (10 / 20 / 30)

PM Insight:  
Segmentation is a product-level scalability and security enabler, not just configuration detail.

---

### 3️⃣ Router Upgrade Logic

Highlights:

- Multi-device scheduling impact  
- Stability vs bandwidth misconception  
- Latency consistency importance  
- Congestion control behavior  

PM Insight:  
User complaints about “slow internet” often stem from scheduling inefficiencies rather than ISP bandwidth limits.

---

### 4️⃣ Wi-Fi Generation Comparison

Interactive comparison across:

- Throughput  
- Latency  
- Reliability  
- Interference handling  

PM Insight:  
Wi-Fi generation positioning must align with device ecosystem maturity, not marketing peak speeds.

---

### 5️⃣ Router × Device Pairing Matrix

Demonstrates performance ceiling logic:

Actual Experience = min(Device Capability, Router Capability)

Clarifies:

- Why upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 does not guarantee maximum performance  
- Why legacy devices gain stability but not peak throughput  
- Where diminishing returns appear in upgrade strategy  

PM Insight:  
Upgrade timing should follow installed base readiness, not just specification availability.

## ⚙️ Implementation

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (custom theme with light/dark mode)  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- IntersectionObserver (navigation awareness)  
- Fully static architecture  

No framework used intentionally to maintain clarity and portability.
